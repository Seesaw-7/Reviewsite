        <h2>A City of Sadness</h2>

        <p id="first-p-A-City-of-Sadness">In the face of momentous times, the fate of ordinary people always
          seems so insignificant that it
          might as well be ignored. Individuals who bravely stand up to try to stop the torrents of the era
          often resemble Don Quixote futilely charging at windmills, usually ending up as martyrs, and more
          often, they don't even have the choice to be bystanders. Yet, the tragedy of ordinary people
          undoubtedly reflects the absurdity and cruelty of history.</p>
        <div id="more-A-City-of-Sadness" style="display: none;">
          <p> After Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945 and Taiwan's subsequent recovery, a Lin family in
            Keelung thought they were about to live better days. However, fate had other plans, and the Lin
            family faced continuous upheavals. After the "February 28 Incident," only the fourth brother,
            Lin
            Wenqing (played by Tony Leung), a deaf-mute who owned a photo studio, remained out of trouble.
            However, the tragedy did not stop there; due to connections with progressive individuals, Lin
            Wenqing could not escape arrest, leaving only him and his infant nephew, Wu Kuan-mei (played by
            Hsin
            Shu-fen), who was still babbling in his cradle.</p>

          about the despair of the end of the

          <p> A politician leaves the parliament and vanishes from his home without a trace. Journalist Gregory
            Karr is reporting on the immigrants and refugees stuck at the border, where he encounters someone
            who greatly resembles the missing politician. He also discovers a town split by a river used as a
            national border, witnessing a surreal wedding with the bride and her family on one side of the river
            and the groom and his guests on the other. The man's identity remains unconfirmed, and the plight of
            the unfortunate refugees and the divided village deepens Karr's despair about the human condition.

        <h2>Andrei Rublev</h2>
        <img src="images/Andrei_Rublev.jpg" width="150" alt="Poster for Andrei Rublev" />
        <p id="first-p-Andrei-Rublev"> At the beginning of the 15th century, during a tumultuous period in Russia, the
          renowned icon
          painter Andrei Rublev (portrayed by Anatoli Solonitsyn) is invited to Moscow by the Grand Prince to
          paint for a church, where he receives aristocratic treatment. However, Rublev finds himself in a
          tragic era ravaged by Tatar invasions and filled with disaster and slaughter. Witnessing the
          suffering of the people under the Grand Prince's tyranny, Rublev decisively leaves the church to
          return to the monastery. Soon, he is forced to return to Moscow to create icons once again.
          Confronted with the innocent slaughter of the residents and the ruthless destruction of churches
          during the wars, Rublev falls into a deep questioning of the huge disparity between art and reality,
          refusing to continue painting. By 1423, the Tatar forces are finally driven out of Russian lands.
          After enduring trials of fire and blood, Rublev ultimately completes his masterpiece, "The Trinity."
        </p>
        <div id="more-Andrei-Rublev" style="display: none;">
          <p>Directed by the Soviet cinematic master Andrei Tarkovsky, the epic film "Andrei Rublev" uses
            Tarkovsky's unique poetic cinematic language and dense, historical mural-like strokes to depict the
            life of wandering and decisions of the famous 15th-century Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev. The
            film was awarded the FIPRESCI Prize at the 22nd Cannes Film Festival in 1969.</p>

        <p id="first-p-Time-of-the-Gypsies"> In the village of Ciganska, on the outskirts of a Balkan city, young Behan
          (played by Davor
          Dujmovic) lives with his grandmother and four family members, including a gambling-addicted uncle,
          Mersan, who pines for his past life in Germany and whose losses at the gambling table have left
          Behan's sister untreated for her leg illness due to lack of money. Behan falls in love with Azna
          from the same village, but her mother rejects him because of his family's poverty. The tribe leader
          Amed, who has been earning money in Italy, returns to the village and gambles with Mersan, driving
          him to insanity and destruction of their wooden hut. However, the grandmother uses witchcraft to
          save Amed's child, and in gratitude, Amed agrees to take the sister abroad for medical treatment and
          also takes Behan, who possesses the unusual ability to move small metal objects through the air.
          Soon, Behan discovers that Amed is just exploiting children for begging and thievery. Despite
          feeling trapped, Behan takes over the gang when Amed falls ill, quickly becoming wealthy. He then
          returns to the village to bring Azna to Milan, but his anger erupts when he learns that Azna is
          pregnant, insisting on selling the child…</p>

          In 1927, a flood of impoverished farmers headed to the Jinguashi area in Jiufen, Taiwan, hoping to
          strike gold and fulfill their dreams. Among them were the simple tenant farmers, the brothers Ah Zhu
          and Ah Wei, who rented a shabby house from the widow Ah Rou. Ah Rou, known as a woman cursed with
          the misfortune of outliving her husbands, gradually develops feelings for Ah Zhu amidst the gold
          rush. The boom brought not only prospectors but also rampant smuggling and prostitution to Jiufen.
          The Japanese authorities appointed the talented Chaita to manage the order of the gold mines.
          However, as miners and brothels colluded and gold trading became increasingly uncontrollable,
          violent conflicts erupted, culminating in the murder of Chaita. Soon after marrying Ah Rou, Ah Zhu
          dies from illness, leaving Ah Rou tearless and desolate. With her four children and her late
          husband's memorial tablet in tow, she leaves Jiufen in solitude…</p>

          Charlotte (played by Ingrid Bergman) is a distinguished pianist in an orchestra, and her daughter
          Eva (played by Liv Ullmann) is the wife of a pastor working in a rural community. There is a
          profound emotional rift between them, and they have not communicated in seven years. After learning
          of the death of Charlotte's second husband, Eva writes to invite Charlotte to stay with her, and
          both try to get along amicably, but inevitably old grievances resurface. Eva resents Charlotte for
          not providing her with enough care during her childhood, focusing instead on her career and
          distancing herself from both Eva and another daughter, Helena (played by Lena Nyman), who has severe
          disabilities and communicates through unclear sounds. Charlotte, already troubled by her husband's
          death, finds her mood further darkened by the living arrangement with Helena and Eva.</p>

          enter a prestigious university to elevate their social status. He had a friend who loved rock music
          and called himself "Little Elvis" (played by Wang Qizan). Although they would go to the woods to
          watch people in secret rendezvous, their lives were very different from those of many youths hanging

        <h2>Intolerance</h2>
        <img src="images/Intolerance.JPG" alt="Intolerance" />
        <p id="first-p-Intolerance">This is D.W. Griffith's most ambitiously creative work. Inspired by the astounding
          box office success
          of "The Birth of a Nation," Griffith was motivated to create a film with even grander scale and
          deeper content. He spent a year and a half and $2 million to produce a film originally 480 minutes
          long, though the final version was cut down to 220 minutes. Unfortunately, when it premiered in New
          York in September 1916, it did not receive the anticipated reception. The film's box office failure
          is attributed to several factors, mainly that Griffith's complex narrative structure and directorial
          techniques surpassed the contemporary audience's understanding. Additionally, its serious themes
          advocating tolerance and opposing violence clashed with America's heightened wartime sentiments,
          limiting its appeal. Nevertheless, it remains undeniable that this film is a timeless masterpiece of
          cinematic art.
        </p>
        <div id="more-Intolerance" style="display: none;">
          <p>"Intolerance" is structured around four distinct historical periods: the fall of Babylon, the
            crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in France, and early 20th-century
            labor conflicts in America. Griffith described his concept as "four great stories that flow together
            like four streams, initially separate and tranquil, but finally converging into a powerful,
            turbulent river." The film begins with a shot of a woman rocking a cradle, accompanied by a Walt
            Whitman poem that reflects on the perpetual cycle of human passions and joys and sorrows. This sets
            the tone for the contemporary story that unfolds first. As the plot progresses, Griffith often cuts
            to the other three stories, developing them in parallel. The film concludes back with the woman and
            the cradle, symbolizing humanity's evolution from intolerance to tolerance.</p>
          <p>The contemporary segment, "Mother and the Law," describes the plight of four unemployed workers from
            a small town seeking work in the city, where they face various misadventures and desires for a
            normal family life. The male protagonist is wrongly accused of murder and sentenced to death, but is
            saved at the last moment by the real perpetrator's confession. This narrative reflects the social
            conditions of early 20th-century America, highlighting rural instability, urban complexity, labor
            hardships, and legal challenges.</p>
          <p>Griffith's film innovatively uses "parallel editing" to compare and contrast similar situations
            across the four storylines, creating a unified and impactful narrative that builds emotional
            climaxes through repeated scenes. Techniques like moving cameras, cross-cutting, and even brief
            flashbacks elevate the storytelling, showcasing Griffith's advanced "film grammar" compared to his
            contemporaries. Additionally, he introduced "close-ups" and "long shots" to enhance the
            psychological impact on viewers, as well as color tinting for special effects (e.g., blue for night
            scenes, yellow for lit interiors, and red for the burning of Babylon), a method not invented by
            Griffith but never used as boldly before in a single film.</p>
          <p>Remarkably, this complex, large-scale production was created without a complete script, relying
            instead on Griffith's improvisational genius. Also, there were no set design plans, yet Griffith
            managed to construct the impressive Babylon set and coordinated scenes using 15,000 extras and 250
            chariots in a single day, surpassing even the grand historical films produced in Italy at the time.
            Griffith's own motto, "Art is often revolutionary, explosive, and thunderous," truly reflects his
            hands-on approach to artistry, as demonstrated in "Intolerance."</p>

        <p>Duan Xiaolou (played by Zhang Fengyi) and Cheng Dieyi (played by Leslie Cheung) are sworn brothers
          who grew up together, with one playing the male roles and the other specializing as the female lead

          "Farewell My Concubine," which brought them immense fame in Beijing. They vowed to perform this play
          together for life. However, their understanding of the relationship between drama and life
          fundamentally differs: Duan Xiaolou recognizes that life is not a stage, whereas Cheng Dieyi blurs
          the line between his roles and his reality.
        </p>
        <p>When Duan Xiaolou decides it's time to settle down, he marries Juxian (played by Gong Li), a
          well-known courtesan. Cheng Dieyi sees Juxian as a shameful interloper, turning Duan Xiaolou into a
          traitor in his eyes. From there, a tumultuous saga of love, hate, and jealousy unfolds around the
          play "Farewell My Concubine," escalating with the changing tides of the era and ultimately leading
          to tragedy.</p>
