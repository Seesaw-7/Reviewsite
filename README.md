# Reviews
A website sharing reviews for books, films and music


## Future work
- Get the image length and width as soon as it is uploaded, and store that values as image properties. Thus, we could use placeholders for images when rendering the page before images are loaded(lasy-load). It should be more visually stable.
- Use backend storage instead of local storage for the website
- Allow users to register.
