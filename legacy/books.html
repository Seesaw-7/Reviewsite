                <h2>A City of Sadness</h2>
                <img src="images/A_city_of_sadness.JPG" width="150" alt="A City of Sadness" />
                <p id="first-p-A-City-of-Sadness">In the face of momentous times, the fate of ordinary people always
                    seems so insignificant that it
                    might as well be ignored. Individuals who bravely stand up to try to stop the torrents of the era
                    often resemble Don Quixote futilely charging at windmills, usually ending up as martyrs, and more
                    often, they don't even have the choice to be bystanders. Yet, the tragedy of ordinary people
                    undoubtedly reflects the absurdity and cruelty of history.</p>
                <div id="more-A-City-of-Sadness" style="display: none;">
                    <p> After Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945 and Taiwan's subsequent recovery, a Lin family in
                        Keelung thought they were about to live better days. However, fate had other plans, and the Lin
                        family faced continuous upheavals. After the "February 28 Incident," only the fourth brother,
                        Lin
                        Wenqing (played by Tony Leung), a deaf-mute who owned a photo studio, remained out of trouble.
                        However, the tragedy did not stop there; due to connections with progressive individuals, Lin
                        Wenqing could not escape arrest, leaving only him and his infant nephew, Wu Kuan-mei (played by
                        Hsin
                        Shu-fen), who was still babbling in his cradle.</p>

                <h2>Absalom, Absalom!</h2>
                <img src="images/Absalom-Absalom.jpg" width="150" alt="Absalom, Absalom!" />
                <p>
                    "Absalom, Absalom!" is one of William Faulkner's most important works, and it is also his most
                    complex, profound, and epic. The novel recounts the intense disintegration of a family in the
                    American South from around 1860 to 1910, deeply portraying various conflicts between people, and
                    within themselves, touching on many universally relevant issues concerning the human condition. The
                    narrative technique of the novel is unique; characters in the book "explain" the past from different
                    perspectives, each infused with their own subjective emotions, yet collectively reflecting the
                    tragic tone of the entire work. The title of the book originates from a Biblical reference, and the
                    novel features themes of love and hatred between parents and children, as well as ambiguous feelings
                    between siblings, reminiscent of Biblical stories.</p>

                <p>This book is a collection of short stories from 1941, containing seven stories. Among them, "The
                    Garden of Forking Paths" is a detective story that describes the preparation and execution of a
                    crime. The Garden of Forking Paths is a riddle, or rather, a parable, and the solution to the riddle
                    is time.</p>

                <p>Since the mid-nineteenth century, with the renewal of poetic concepts, poets have explored new
                    domains in the content of poetry and conducted various experiments in the forms and techniques of
                    expression. The emergence of modern free verse and modern prose poetry marks the arrival of a new
