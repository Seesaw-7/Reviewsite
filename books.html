                <h2>Absalom, Absalom!</h2>
                <img src="images/Absalom-Absalom.jpg" width="150" alt="Absalom, Absalom!" />
                <p>
                    "Absalom, Absalom!" is one of William Faulkner's most important works, and it is also his most
                    complex, profound, and epic. The novel recounts the intense disintegration of a family in the
                    American South from around 1860 to 1910, deeply portraying various conflicts between people, and
                    within themselves, touching on many universally relevant issues concerning the human condition. The
                    narrative technique of the novel is unique; characters in the book "explain" the past from different
                    perspectives, each infused with their own subjective emotions, yet collectively reflecting the
                    tragic tone of the entire work. The title of the book originates from a Biblical reference, and the
                    novel features themes of love and hatred between parents and children, as well as ambiguous feelings
                    between siblings, reminiscent of Biblical stories.</p>

                <p>This book is a collection of short stories from 1941, containing seven stories. Among them, "The
                    Garden of Forking Paths" is a detective story that describes the preparation and execution of a
                    crime. The Garden of Forking Paths is a riddle, or rather, a parable, and the solution to the riddle
                    is time.</p>

                <p>Since the mid-nineteenth century, with the renewal of poetic concepts, poets have explored new

                    expression. The emergence of modern free verse and modern prose poetry marks the arrival of a new
